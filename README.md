<h1>Mock Website Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Website project where I designed a mock website meant to illustrate what a community/player lead website might look like for the game Armored Core 6(Owned by: FromSoftware and BandaiNamco). The idea is that this site would be used by the community to find and share events or builds(creations in game). I have used each site page to illustrate features I would like this site to possess, such as: build code sharing, login/user features, and the ability for users to make their own posts. It also shows the basic site shape that could be used a prototype for future implementation. This was used to practice my: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and FlexBox skills for web development.
