Notes and Philosophy on Licensing: 
I do not own or claim to own any aspect of Armored Core 6. This mock site is used as an example of a community lead site that could potentially exist, based around the game Armored Core 6, developed by FromSoftware and Published by BandaiNamco.
All images, references, and names are owned by these companies themselves and I am simply using these assets to practice my web design skills, for no profit. If this were to be real site, all images would used would be altered and made to 
be created only by myself/partners to avoid any legal issues. Thank you for taking the time to read this note.
